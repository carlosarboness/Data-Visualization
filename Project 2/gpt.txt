Which weather condition and type of vehicle were present in the majority of accidents each month? And in the combination of all the months?

I would create an interactive stacked bar chart for each month, where the x-axis represents the type of vehicle, the y-axis represents the number of accidents, and each bar is stacked by different weather conditions. Additionally, I would include a dropdown menu or a slider to allow users to select a specific month. For the combination of all months, a similar stacked bar chart can be used without the monthly filter.

In which area and at what hour did the majority of accidents each month happen? And in the combination of all the months?

I would design an interactive heatmap where the x-axis represents the hour of the day, the y-axis represents different areas in New York City, and the color intensity represents the number of accidents. Users can interactively select a specific month using a dropdown or slider. For the combination of all months, a unified heatmap can be presented.

Which area presented the majority of taxi accidents during rainy days in June on Mondays at noon, 12 pm?

I would create an interactive map of New York City, where users can filter by June, Mondays, and noon. Points on the map would represent accident locations, and the color or size of the points would indicate the severity or frequency of accidents. Additionally, users can toggle a filter for rainy days, and the map updates accordingly.

Which day had more accidents during clear days in July in Manhattan?

I would design a line chart with the x-axis representing the days of July, the y-axis representing the number of accidents, and different lines for each day. Users can filter the chart to show only clear days and focus specifically on Manhattan. Interactive elements such as tooltips can provide detailed information when hovering over data points.
