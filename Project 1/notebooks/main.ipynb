Firstly, these columns contained a significant number of blank values, with 'On Street Name' having approximately 28,000 blanks, 'Cross Street Name' over 57,000 blanks, and 'Off Street Name' about 80,000 blanks. The prevalence of missing data in these columns significantly affected the overall data quality.\n",

    "Furthermore, the information contained within these columns was found to be redundant, and the extensive variety of street names made it challenging to derive meaningful insights or create compelling visualizations based on these columns. To fulfill the need for location-related information, we have chosen to rely on the 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns, which provide more structured and comprehensive geographic data. This not only reduces redundancy but also enhances data clarity and usability for our visualization project."

    "For both 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1' and 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2,' a comprehensive data standardization process was undertaken. Initially, we applied clustering techniques using the Nearest Neighbor Method and Key Collision Method to harmonize and unify vehicle type names. These automated methods aided in resolving many inconsistencies caused by human errors.\n",

    "Recognizing that the automated clustering did not catch all errors, we conducted a meticulous manual review of vehicle type names. In cases where specific vehicles were inaccurately described, we updated their names. For instance, we found entries like 'GLP050VXEV,' which, upon internet research, was identified as a forklift model, so we modified it accordingly. Similar manual refinements were applied to various other vehicle types to improve accuracy and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we adopted a generalization approach to simplify overly specific vehicle types. For example, entities like 'FedEx,' 'UPS,' 'mail' and others were categorized under 'delivery' to reduce the number of distinct vehicle classes.\n",

    "To further enhance data consistency, vehicle types with fewer than ten collisions were grouped under the 'others' category to streamline the dataset and reduce the number of unique names.\n",

These preprocessing steps aimed to standardize and simplify the vehicle type data, making it more manageable and coherent for our analysis and visualization efforts."
